Our app also features two google API's that access you calendar and task. These are then listed in our app for you viewing!

NOTE
-----------
Public credentials are currently unavailable as the app is currently unapproved on Google Developer API (due to time constraints) and credential generation wasn't viable for a public platform with test users; therefore, the code may not execute successfully given these circumstances!
